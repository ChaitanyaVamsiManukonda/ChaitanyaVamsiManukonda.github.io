                            <p>May 2023, The University of Memphis</p>
                            <p>This project aimed to develop a machine learning model to forecast the weekly sales of a grocery store, thereby enhancing inventory control and decision-making processes which employs advanced machine learning techniques to create a predictive model that enhances inventory management and maintenance scheduling in grocery stores.</p>

                            <h2>MODELING AND ANALYSIS OF NON-PNEUMATIC TYRES WITH DIFFERENT DESIGN STRUCTURES USING FEM METHOD</h2>
                            <p>April 2021, R.V.R. & J.C. College of Engineering</p>
                            <p>The project is centered around the Analysis of non-pneumatic tires, innovatively designed to circumvent the drawbacks associated with traditional pneumatic tires. This groundbreaking endeavor replaces the conventional reliance on air pressure with a robust, airless system, aiming to eliminate issues such as punctures and the constant need for pressure maintenance. Our focus is mainly on Analyzing the efficiency of different structures of the designs by simulation and finding out the best design.</p>

                            <h2>Energy Generation with Parabolic Thin Film Photovoltaic Modules by Integration of Stirling Engine</h2>
                            <p>May 2021, R.V.R. & J.C. College of Engineering</p>
                            <p>This project presents a novel approach to solar energy collection by combining parabolic concentrators with thin-film photovoltaic (PV) modules and Stirling engines. By capturing both direct solar radiation and its reflective losses, the setup aims to enhance the overall energy efficiency significantly. The system eschews traditional anti-reflective coatings to maintain the Stirling engine's operational efficacy, thereby maximizing the conversion of captured solar energy into electricity.</p>
